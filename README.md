# GirlsGetGeeky
GirlsGetGeeky is a project meant to address the following issues:
- Poor internet  hindering the ability for beginners to access good courses with solutions to common problems.
- Minute number of ladies in tech and STEM in general, in Kenya and other African countries. A large number of those   who take a technology course in the University end up taking a job parallel to tech. 
- For beginners, there is no a structured course /syllabus to help them move from beginner to advanced level

## Our Goal
- Build a fun offline course  available on usb sticks, that has all the important resources that one needs to effectively learn the programming language in question. We will begin with Ruby on Rails then later add more languages.

## Contributing
We welcome devs who are proficient in Ruby on Rails for our first course  test language.
